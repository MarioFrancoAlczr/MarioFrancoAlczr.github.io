<h2 style="background:	#0B0B3B; color:Black; font-weight:bold; padding:15px; border:6px solid #000000	; margin-top:20px; margin-bottom:20px; text-align:center; font-size:25px;">Passive security threats:</h2>
<p  style="background:	#0B0B3B; color:Black; font-weight:bold; padding:15px; border:6px solid #000000	; margin-top:20px; margin-bottom:20px; text-align:center; font-size:22px;">A Passive attack attempts to learn or make use of information from the system but does not affect system resources. Passive Attacks are in the nature of eavesdropping on or monitoring of transmission. The goal of the opponent is to obtain information is being transmitted. There are some different types of passive attacks:</p>
<ul>
     <li style="background:	#0B0B3B; color:Black; font-weight:bold; padding:15px; border:6px solid #000000	; margin-top:20px; margin-bottom:20px; text-align:center; font-size:25px;">The release of message content:
Telephonic conversation, an electronic mail message or a transferred file may contain sensitive or confidential information. We would like to prevent an opponent from learning the contents of these transmissions.

	 <li style="background:	#0B0B3B; color:Black; font-weight:bold; padding:15px; border:6px solid #000000	; margin-top:20px; margin-bottom:20px; text-align:center; font-size:22px;">Traffic analysis:
Suppose that we had a way of masking (encryption) of information, so that the attacker even if captured the message could not extract any information from the message.
The opponent could determine the location and identity of communicating host and could observe the frequency and length of messages being exchanged. This information might be useful in guessing the nature of the communication that was taking place.

<h2 style="background:	#0B0B3B; color:Black; font-weight:bold; padding:15px; border:6px solid #000000	; margin-top:20px; margin-bottom:20px; text-align:center; font-size:25px;">Active security threats:</h2>
<p style="background:	#0B0B3B; color:Black; font-weight:bold; padding:15px; border:6px solid #000000	; margin-top:20px; margin-bottom:20px; text-align:center; font-size:22px;"> An Active attack attempts to alter system resources or effect their operations. Active attack involve some modification of the data stream or creation of false statement. There are some different types of active attacks:</p>
<ul>
      <li style="background:	#0B0B3B; color:Black; font-weight:bold; padding:15px; border:6px solid #000000	; margin-top:20px; margin-bottom:20px; text-align:center; font-size:18px;">Masquerade:
Masquerade attack takes place when one entity pretends to be different entity. A Masquerade attack involves one of the other form of active attacks.
<img src="https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/new3-1.png" alt ="Masquerade" width="400" height="200"></li>
      <li style="background:	#0B0B3B; color:Black; font-weight:bold; padding:15px; border:6px solid #000000	; margin-top:20px; margin-bottom:20px; text-align:center; font-size:20px;">Modification of messages:
It means that some portion of a message is altered or that message is delayed or reordered to produce an unauthorised effect. For example, a message meaning “Allow JOHN to read confidential file X” is modified as “Allow Smith to read confidential file X”.
<img src="https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/new4.png" alt ="Modification of messages" width="400" height="200"></li>
      <li style="background:	#0B0B3B; color:Black; font-weight:bold; padding:15px; border:6px solid #000000	; margin-top:20px; margin-bottom:20px; text-align:center; font-size:22px;">Repudiation:
This attack is done by either sender or receiver. The sender or receiver can deny later that he/she has send or receive a message. For example, customer ask his Bank “To transfer an amount to someone” and later on the sender(customer) deny that he had made such a request. This is repudiation.</li>
      <li style="background:	#0B0B3B; color:Black; font-weight:bold; padding:15px; border:6px solid #000000	; margin-top:20px; margin-bottom:20px; text-align:center; font-size:22px;">Replay:
It involves the passive capture of a message and its subsequent the transmission to produce an authorized effect.
<img src="https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/new5.png" alt ="Replay" width="400" height="200"></li>
      <li style="background:	#0B0B3B; color:Black; font-weight:bold; padding:15px; border:6px solid #000000	; margin-top:20px; margin-bottom:20px; text-align:center; font-size:25px;">Denial of Service:
It prevents normal use of communication facilities. This attack may have a specific target. For example, an entity may suppress all messages directed to a particular destination. Another form of service denial is the disruption of an entire network wither by disabling the network or by overloading it by messages so as to degrade performance.

<h2 style="background:	#0B0B3B; color:Black; font-weight:bold; padding:15px; border:6px solid #000000	; margin-top:20px; margin-bottom:20px; text-align:center; font-size:22px;">Malware:</h2>
<h2 style="background:	#0B0B3B; color:Black; font-weight:bold; padding:15px; border:6px solid #000000	; margin-top:20px; margin-bottom:20px; text-align:center; font-size:20px;">Malware (a portmanteau for malicious software) is any software intentionally designed to cause damage to a computer, server, client, or computer network(by contrast, software that causes unintentional harm due to some deficiency is typically described as a software bug).
Programs are also considered malware if they secretly act against the interests of the computer user. For example, at one point Sony music Compact discs silently installed a rootkit on purchasers' computers with the intention of preventing illicit copying, but which also reported on users' listening habits, and unintentionally created extra security vulnerabilities.
A range of antivirus software, firewalls and other strategies are used to help protect against the introduction of malware, to help detect it if it is already present, and to recover from malware-associated malicious activity and attacks.

<h3 style="background:	#0B0B3B; color:Black; font-weight:bold; padding:15px; border:6px solid #000000	; margin-top:20px; margin-bottom:20px; text-align:center; font-size:22px;">Worms</h3>
<p  style="background:	#0B0B3B; color:Black; font-weight:bold; padding:15px; border:6px solid #000000	; margin-top:20px; margin-bottom:20px; text-align:center; font-size:15px;">A computer worm is a standalone malware computer program that replicates itself in order to spread to other computers. It often uses a computer network to spread itself, relying on security failures on the target computer to access it. It will use this machine as a host to scan and infect other computers. When these new worm-invaded computers are controlled, the worm will continue 
to scan and infect other computers using these computers as hosts, and this behaviour will continue.Computer worms use recursive methods to copy themselves without host programs and distribute themselves based on the law of exponential growth, thus controlling and infecting more and more computers in a short time. Worms almost always cause at least some harm to the network, even if only by consuming bandwidth, whereas viruses almost always corrupt or modify files on a targeted computer.

Many worms are designed only to spread, and do not attempt to change the systems they pass through.

<h3 style="background:	#0B0B3B; color:Black; font-weight:bold; padding:15px; border:6px solid #000000	; margin-top:20px; margin-bottom:20px; text-align:center; font-size:22px;">Trojan horse</h3>
<p style="background:	#0B0B3B; color:Black; font-weight:bold; padding:15px; border:6px solid #000000	; margin-top:20px; margin-bottom:20px; text-align:center; font-size:20px;"> In computing, a Trojan horse[a] (or simply trojan)[b] is any malware which misleads users of its true intent. The term is derived from the Ancient Greek story of the deceptive Trojan Horse that led to the fall of the city of Troy.

Trojans are generally spread by some form of social engineering, for example where a user is duped into executing an email attachment disguised to appear not suspicious, (e.g., a routine form to be filled in), or by clicking on some fake advertisement on social media or anywhere else. Although their payload can be anything, many modern forms act as a backdoor, contacting a controller which can then have unauthorized access to the affected computer.Trojans may allow an attacker to access users' personal information such as banking information, passwords, or personal identity. It can also delete a user's files or infect other devices connected to the network. Ransomware attacks are often carried out using a trojan.
Unlike computer viruses, worms, and rogue security software, trojans generally do not attempt to inject themselves into other files or otherwise propagate themselves.

<h3 style="background:	#0B0B3B; color:Black; font-weight:bold; padding:15px; border:6px solid #000000	; margin-top:20px; margin-bottom:20px; text-align:center; font-size:22px;">Virus</h3>
<p style="background:	#0B0B3B; color:Black; font-weight:bold; padding:15px; border:6px solid #000000	; margin-top:20px; margin-bottom:20px; text-align:center; font-size:17.5px;"> A computer virus is a type of computer program that, when executed, replicates itself by modifying other computer programs and inserting its own code. If this replication succeeds, the affected areas are then said to be "infected" with a computer virus.

Computer viruses generally require a host program. The virus writes its own code into the host program. When the program runs, the written virus program is executed first, causing infection and damage. A computer worm does not need a host program, as it is an independent program or code chunk. Therefore, it is not restricted by the host program, but can run independently and actively carry out attacks.
Computer viruses cause billions of dollars' worth of economic damage each year.

<p  style="background:	#0B0B3B; color:Black; font-weight:bold; padding:15px; border:6px solid #000000	; margin-top:20px; margin-bottom:20px; text-align:center; font-size:20px;">Spyware describes software with malicious behavior that aims to gather information about a person or organization and send such information to another entity in a way that harms the user; for example by violating their privacy or endangering their device's security. This behavior may be present in malware as well as in legitimate software. Websites may engage in spyware behaviors like web tracking. Hardware devices may also be affected.
 Spyware is frequently associated with advertising and involves many of the same issues. Because these behaviors are so common, and can have non-harmful uses, providing a precise definition of spyware is a difficult task
